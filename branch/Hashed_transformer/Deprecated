Compiles: No

Primary idea: 
I don't rem

Reason for deprecation:
- Performed poorly, as I couldn't find a good way to incorperate all of the tage information easily 
- Unable to incorperate primary bimodal table into inputs 

Possibilities for further research
- It's possible with the new token method that each table could be sent as a token,
 this would allow us to incorperate all of the context my initial implementation missed
