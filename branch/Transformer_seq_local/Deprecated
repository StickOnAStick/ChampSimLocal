Compiles: Yes

Primary idea: 
Same as Transformer_SEQ, but we give it local history and IP,
however it looks like at some point i removed that so it's pretty much a copy of Transformer_SEQ

Reason for deprecation:
- Poor performance 
- Any sequence > 1 leads to worse performance 
- Had similar problems to what we discused, indexed local histories don't make sense in a linear time sequence, so the transformer gets confused
