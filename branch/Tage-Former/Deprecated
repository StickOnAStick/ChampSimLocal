Compiles: No

Primary idea: 
Give the transformer the inputs from the tage tables because the tage tables already have the context to make good 
predictions, the transformer only needs to learn what makes those good at predicting. 

Reason for deprecation:
- Performed poorly, as I couldn't find a good way to incorperate all of the tage information easily 
- Unable to incorperate primary bimodal table into inputs 

Possibilities for further research
- It's possible with the new token method that each table could be sent as a token,
 this would allow us to incorperate all of the context my initial implementation missed
